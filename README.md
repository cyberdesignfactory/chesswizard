## TODO

- Wizard should avoid checkmate and value checkmating
- Have board shrink if necessary for smaller width screens
- Port to re-frame
- Improve namespaces (cdf.cw.*)
- Display reason why a move is invalid (when user attempts to select 'to' square)
- Notation supports disambiguation
- Wizard could perhaps think more moves ahead when less pieces on the board
